# EComm Application
This app is basis an application from the Udemy course _Microfrontends with React: A Complete Developers Guide_. 

It demonstrates a Container app that loads 2 modules via Webpack Module Federation.

I have enriched the example with CSS styling within each component.

## Motivation
The reason for writing this app was to follow along with the course and learn more about Webpack Module Federation.

## Application State
Application will display a single page with dummy data you cannot interact with.

## How to Use
Ensure the Products and Cart projects are up and running before starting the container

```bash
cd product
npm run start
```

```bash
cd cart
npm run start
```

Then start container app
```bash
cd container
npm run start
```
